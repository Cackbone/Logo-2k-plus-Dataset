## Logo-2k+ Dataset Description
In this work, we construct a large scale logo dataset, Logo-2K+, which covers a diverse range of logo classes from real-world logo images.
Our resulting logo dataset contains `167,140` images with 10 root categories and `2,341` categories. \
The statistic comparison of 10 root categories from Logo-2K+ is shown as follows.
